# number_puzzle_cli
just for fun 

# NOTE!
it wrote on linux so if you are in window you should add <tt>#include <windows.h></tt> and change <tt>system("clear");</tt> to <tt>system("cls");</tt>, and also remove that part is related to getch() func on main.h file and add <b>#include <conio.h></b> to first of main.cpp file.<br>
  <h3>GOOD LUCK</h3>
